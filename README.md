About: This CRUD app features miscellaneous blogs with a rabbit hole theme from Alice and Wonderland. You are able to enter the splash page which takes you to the index of blogs already created. From there you can create a new blog or click on an existing blog to edit or delete from the database.

Technical details: Each blog has a certified timestamp when it was created. The blogs have physical links you can click to take you to the blog for reading, editing or deleting. The index has a New blog button that takes you to create a new blog. The show and edit pages have back buttons to take you back to the index page. I used partials for the header and footer on my ejs pages. I created an extra route for my splash page.

Technical challenges: I tried to create auths with a login bar at the top of my index page. I spent a full day Monday trying to get that to work and retreated back to the original model and restful routes. i tried adding social media icons but could not get them to work.

Improvements: I would definitely get auths working along with the social media icons, I would improve the css and styling. i need to work on keeping my css more organized with my pages. I ran in to problems setting my containers and I went backwards a lot instead of forwards.
